### Audience

Prospective Users of CenturyLink Cloud

### How do I get a free trial?

Visit [www.ctl.io/free-trial](http://www.ctl.io/free-trial). You will need a valid credit card (Visa or Mastercard only - American Express, Discover, and pre-paid credit cards are not accepted) and a mobile phone that supports text messaging, which is used to verify your identity and prevent fraudulent usage.

### What's included with a free trial?

Each free trial includes:

* Up to $500 in usage of the service
* Self-service access to CenturyLink Cloud services, including cloud servers, block storage, load balancers, VLANs, and much more
* [Developer Support](http://www.ctl.io/support/) - this can be upgraded at anytime upon request. If you are still in your trial period, the expense will be covered by your trial credit.

There are also some limits on rapid scale-up of resources, please contact [help@ctl.io](mailto:help@ctl.io) for more details.

When your trial is exhausted, you will be billed on a monthly basis for consumption of services in your account, as defined by our [Pricing Catalog](https://www.ctl.io/pricing).

### How long does it take to get a free trial account activated?

After you have entered the verification code, provided a valid credit card (Visa or Mastercard only - American Express, Discover, and pre-paid credit cards are not accepted), and completed the activation form, your account will be created instantly. You will then receive an email with your account details. Representatives from CenturyLink Cloud will be in touch shortly thereafter to help you make the most of your trial.

### Is there an expiration time on the free trial?

Yes. The trial credits will expire after 90 days.

### Who do I contact if my account is not immediately created?

Please send an email to [help@ctl.io](mailto:help@ctl.io) with relevant details.
